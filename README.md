# Detecting Spam messages

Getting a dataset from Kaggle and training a model using SciKit Learn which can identify whether the message is Spam or not.
Validating the model using 2/3rd of the dataset for training and the rest for testing.
Measuring F1 and AUC scores because of the class imbalances to verify if the model is working properly.
Plotting different plots like Histograms and Confusion Matrices to understand the dataset and for the validation.
Visualizing through WordCloud to understand which words are often used in Spam Messages.
Finally, figuring out all the wrong predictions and why might that be happening.

SPAMMERS STAY AWAY!!
